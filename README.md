HR analytics is all about using data to understand and improve the way organizations manage their people.
Imagine if a company could use data to figure out the best places to find new employees, or to understand what makes employees perform their best at work. 

HR analytics does just that. It takes all the information a company has about its employees – like how they're doing, what they're interested in, and how long they stay – and turns it into insights that help the company make better decisions.

The hypotheses for  this project are: 
1.Gender might affect salary levels within the company.
2. Variations in age among employees could potentially influence salary disparities.
3. Employees with higher levels of education may earn higher salaries.
4. Employees with a longer employment duration may receive more positive performance reviews.

Tools Used
Jupyter Notebook: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.

Insights:
1. The lack of significant correlation between gender, age, or education level with salary levels suggests that the company's compensation structure may be fair and unbiased, fostering trust and morale among employees.

2. Additionally, the absence of a huge disparity between employment duration and performance reviews indicates that the performance evaluation process prioritizes merit and achievements over seniority. 

3. However, while the lack of significant correlations may seem positive, there might still be a need for thorough analysis to gain a more comprehensive understanding, and ensure that all the t’s are crossed and all the i’s dotted  with reference to workforce management strategies.
